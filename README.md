# Node-RED Matter Bridge

WORK IN PROGRESS    

The goal is to implement a Matter device bridge in Node-RED so that Nodes may appear to the Matter fabric as devices.

Currently only basic on/off Lights, Dimmable Lights and On/Off Sockets are implemented.

This is using the matter.js libraries which as of Sep 2023 are still under development themselves.
